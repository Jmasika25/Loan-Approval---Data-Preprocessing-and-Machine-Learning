# Loan-Approval---Data-Preprocessing-and-Machine-Learning

## Project Overview

The project involved Data preprocessing where tools such as Label Encoding, StandardScaler and/or MinMaxScaler were used on ordinal and Nominal columns. A ColumnTransformer tool was also to handle a mix of data types in a pipeline. 

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) was performed where several columns were visualized using plots such as Histogram for continuous columns, Bar plots for Discrete columns and Scatter plots to determine how columns are distributed and structured in the dataset. 

Machine Learning involved Splitting the data into training and testing sets, fitting several classification algorithms from the ensemble library -- Ensemble techniques such as Random Forest classifier.

Evaluation of the models was performed using Accuracy scores, Confusion Matrix, Classification reports that records the precision, recall and f1-score, Area Under the Curve and ROC curves. The most optimal model was deployed using Gradio for later use.
